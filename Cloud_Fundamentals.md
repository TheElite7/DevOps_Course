### Hypervisor Virtualization

* The fundation of creation of virutal machines as guest OS that can consume hardware resources with the perception that they are the only system doing so.
* There are two of Hypervisor,
  * Type II
    * This Hypervisors are Virtualization of a guest OS in the form of an application or process.
    * These hypervisors predate the cloud and were used on desktops and servers to emulate environments on traditional OS being dozens of giabytes in size in support of necessary application environments.
  * Type I
     * This Hypervisores, also known as bare metal. are installed on as a kernal system on the harware as a very small form factory system measuring in size of megabytes to a few hundred kilobytes.
     * This is the hypervisor of the modern day cloud.
